# Fake-News-Detection

This project identifies whether a news article is real or fake using machine learning.

# Model Training

After feature engineering, three algorithms were tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and PassiveAggressiveClassifier. The PassiveAggressiveClassifier performed the best and was selected as the final model. Hyperparameter tuning was applied to improve results.

# Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using accuracy. After evaluation, it is used to predict labels for new and unseen articles.
